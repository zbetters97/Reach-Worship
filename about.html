          <p>
            Reach Worship is the worship ministry of Reach Church in Bear,
            Delaware. Every Sunday, Reach Worship leads the church in praising
            God using music from Christian worship artists, such as Hillsong
            Worship, Elevation Worship, and Jesus Culture, as well as their own
            original worship songs. The band released their first EP in January
            2018, simply titled, “Reach Worship (EP),” featuring their first hit
            song, “Power to Save.” Whether it be publishing their own original
            music or leading a sanctuary of hundreds of people in praise, Reach
            Worship exists to point people back to the central figure of
            Christianity, of the church, and of human history – no one else but
            Jesus Christ.

                continue to build our team with people who share a focus on
                Jesus Christ. It is incredible to hear our church sing our
                songs, which were all written to reflect God’s work at Reach
                Church. Continuing this pursuit is close to our hearts, and, as
                we move along, our hope is that we would continue to reach all
                people with hearing nothing but the name of Jesus through our
                music and our ministry."

                everything that we as a band and a church stand for. My hope is

                our listener's lives."

                'Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and
                admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns
                and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God.'

                for me can be challenging. Since I am sitting in an enclosed
                space that is far from the congregation, I often feel distant
                from everyone’s energy. But, I know that playing my instrument
                to the best of my God-given ability is a beautiful form of
                worship pleasing to Him. Realizing this allows me to be fully
                involved in the worship that we bring to God."
